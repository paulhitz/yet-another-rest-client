		<p>Hi there</p>
		<p>The inspiration for this tool came from frustration with the quality of the tools available to debug RESTful APIs. Each REST Client I used had issues and never quite worked the way I would have liked it to. In the end, I decided to attempt to build something useful myself.</p>
		<p>This tool is that attempt. It's the result of many late evenings and long weekends. Whether it successfully delivers or is yet another second-rate tool is something I leave to the user to decide :)</p>
		<p>I hope it helps make life a little bit easier for whoever uses it.</p>
		<p><em>Sl√°inte!</em></p>
